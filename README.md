## Libraries

- [Sal (Scroll Animation Library)](https://github.com/mciastek/sal) was created to provide a performant and lightweight solution for animating elements on scroll. It's based on the Intersection Observer, which gives amazing performance in terms of checking the element's presence in the viewport.
